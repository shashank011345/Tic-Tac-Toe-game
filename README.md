# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
The primary goal of this project is to create a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns, mark their moves, and determine the game's outcome based on classic win conditions. The game board will be a 3x3 grid, and players will alternate marking their symbols (X or O) in the grid cells. The user interface will display the current player's turn and the game's result, whether it's a win, tie, or ongoing. The game will be styled using CSS for an appealing look and responsive design, ensuring it works seamlessly across different screen sizes. JavaScript will be used to handle game logic, including player moves, win conditions, and game status updates.
